# Titanic-Assignment

Questions:
1. Please show all the information that belongs to the first five passengers. You should have 5
rows each referring to a passenger, and the values of 12 features(columns) for each passenger.

2. Please show the size and dimension of the dataset: (number of passangers, number of
features). Do not forget to write what the output of your script refers to.

3. Please check how many missing values there are in the dataset for each feature column.
Missing values will have a null value (NaN). Do not forget to write which classes have missing
values, and how many missing values in the comments.

4. Please create a pie chart which shows the percentage of passengers that survived and the
percentage of the passengers that did not survive. Explain in your comments if more people
have survived or did not survive.

5. Please create a bar chart that shows the number of female passengers and the total number
of male passengers (You should have two bars referring to female and male)

6. Please create a bar chart that shows the number of females and males who survived and who
did not survive. (You should have four bars referring females who survived and didn’t survive
and males who survived and didn’t survive)

7. Please create a bar chart that shows the surival rates of females and males. (You should have
two bars referring to female and male) Explain your observations in your comments, are there
more female or male passengers in total? Did more females or males survive? What might be
the reason?

8. Please create a cross table as shown below (x will be computed and included in your answer).
The cross table makes it possible to get information about how many people in the 2nd class
have survived etc. Please indicate which class has the most number of survivors? Which class
has the lowest number of survivors? Manually compute the rate for each class: number of
survivors in that class/all passengers in that class.

9. Please create a bar chart that shows the number of passengers who survived and who didn’t
survive for each class. (You should have 6 bars in total)

10. Please create a cross table as shown below (x will be computed and included in your answer).
(Simiar to Q8 but gender information is added). Explain which gender had a higher survival
rate? What might be the reason?

11. What is the age of the olders passenger?

12. What is the age of the youngest passenger?

13. What is the average age of the passengers?

14. Please plot the histogram that shows the age distribution of the passengers who survived.
(You should have 10 bins for the range of the ages.)

15. Please plot the histogram that shows the age distibution of the passengers who didn’t survive.
(You should have 10 bins for the range of the ages.)
Please explain your findings relating the Q14 and Q15 in writing.

16. How much is the the lowest fare?

17. How much is the highest fare?

18. How much is the average fare?

19. Please plot the histogram that shows the distribution of passengers according to the fare they
paid. (You should have 10 bins for the range of the ages.)

20. Are there any children under the age of 10 traveling without their parents? What might this
indicate?
